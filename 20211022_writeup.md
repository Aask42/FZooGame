## Discovered Flaw

Regarding ZOOGAME.APP, I've identified what I believe to be, a CRITICAL security bug/vulnerability (along with an additional flaw). This is my effort to document and share what was found, as well as provide the necessary information for the developers of ZooGame.app to remediate these flaws. There is currently no official bug bounty program published for ZooGame.app, and thus this report has been directly submitted to the ZooGame.app team. It is my hope that this work helps establish a bug bounty program at ZooGame.app and that we may continue to drive our goals of Responsible Disclosure and helping secure this community you are building.
